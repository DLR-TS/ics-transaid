The distribution is specified by a series of calls to the CDF member function, specifying a value and the probability that the function value is less than the specified value. When values are requested, a uniform random variable is used to select a probability, and the return value is interpreted linearly between the two appropriate points in the CDF. The method is known as inverse transform sampling: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling). " alt="" coords="12,80,164,107"/>
