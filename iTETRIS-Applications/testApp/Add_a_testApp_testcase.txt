1) Start the iCS test suite -> transaid/iCS/tests/runTests.sh
2) Copy test basic/testApp_simpleExecute, rename it, and add a brief description what the test is supposed to do (all from within the texttest GUI)
3) Edit the file data/test-config-file.xml and replace the test-case appropriately (no whitespaces or special characters), say 'myTest'
4) In testApp/src/app-main.cpp -> main() add the test case to the set of known cases
5) Everywhere, where testcase-specific output or interaction with the simulation is executed, guard the code with 'if (ProgramConfiguration::GetTestCase() == "myTest")'.
   Usually, this code should be located in the file behaviour-test-node.cpp in the folder src/test
